# optim_algos

Implementations of algorithms for solving basic but often encountered optimizations problems for educational purposes.

  --> Python directory: numpy, nptyping, matplotlib are required \\
      Available Objectives:
        L-smooth, mu-strongly convex objective. \\
      Available Algorithms: \\
      - Gradient Descent.
      - Accelerated Gradient Descent (Nesterov Accelerated Gradient).
      For both algorithmic settings the default values for the stepsize parameters are the optimal ones.
      
  --> MatrixLS_Sparsity_Constraints: Eigen library is required (C++ code)
      Solving a Matrix Least Squares Problem under sparsity constraints.
      Available Algorithms:
      - Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM).
      - Fast Iterative Shrinkage/Thresholding Algorithm.

More problem settings and algorithms will be available soon.
